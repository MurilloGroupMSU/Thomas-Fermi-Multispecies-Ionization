# Thomas-Fermi-Multispecies-Ionization

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that contains Python code to compute the ionization of a dense plasma mixture. The physics model is based on a Thomas-Fermi <Z> routine originally produced by R. M. More. We adapted that approach to the case of a mixture with an arbitrary number of species.

The notebook contains further background on the purpose and use of the code, the numerical algorithm and libraries and two examples with plots. 

If you use this code, or any derivative of it, we would sure appreciate you citing our PRX paper: PRX 8, 021044 (2018).

If you have any questions, please let us know.
